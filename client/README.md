# 🧪 Lead Management Task (Frontend / Backend / Full Stack)

Thank you for showing interest in our Full Stack Developer role!

This is a practical evaluation task designed to help us understand your skills and thinking approach. You can choose to complete:

👉 **Frontend only**  
👉 **Backend only**  
👉 **Or Full Stack** — based on your strengths.

---

## 🎯 Task Overview

Build a simple **Lead Management Module** with the following core features:

### Frontend (React + Tailwind provided)
- Lead Capture Form with validations
- Lead List displaying submitted data
- Clear component structure
- Basic responsive design

### Backend (Optional if not applying for frontend only)
- Express.js or similar backend
- Routes for adding and retrieving leads
- MongoDB (or a mock JSON DB if needed)
- Proper schema validation

---

## 📦 Starter Code

This repo includes a basic React + Tailwind setup. You are free to expand the folder structure as needed.

### 📁 Suggested Folder Structure (for full stack)
```
src/             → Frontend code
server/          → Backend code
  ├── models/
  ├── routes/
  ├── controllers/
  └── config/
```

---

## ✅ Instructions

- Write clean and original code — **no Copilot, templates, or AI-generated code.**
- Add your own UI/UX improvements or logic enhancements.
- If something is unclear, **mention it in this README** or as a comment in the code.
- Stick to functionality, not perfection — we want to see *your approach*.

## 🛠 Sample API Spec

If you're doing the backend:
```
POST   /api/leads       → Add a new lead
        Body: { name, email, phone }

GET    /api/leads       → Get list of leads
```

---

## ⏱ Time Guideline

We expect this to take **2–4 hours** depending on the scope (frontend/backend/full stack).

---

## 📤 What to Submit

- GitHub repo link (or ZIP)
- Mention clearly if you did **frontend**, **backend**, or **full stack**
- (Optional) 1–2 screenshots or a short Loom video to explain your work

---

## ⚠️ Edge Case Reminders

- Validate required fields (e.g., email, phone)
- Handle API/network errors gracefully
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

---

## 💡 Bonus (Optional)

Go the extra mile by adding:
- Edit/Delete functionality for leads
- Search or pagination
- Toast notifications for actions
- Hosting (Vercel/Render/Netlify)

We look forward to seeing your creativity and coding style! 🚀
